# disaster_recovery - Scenario 3
#
# Integration test with 4 nodes (A, B, C, and D), each having its own producer and finalizer. The finalizer policy
# consists of the four finalizers with a threshold of 3. The proposer policy involves all four proposers.
#
# - At least two of the four nodes have a LIB N and a finalizer safety information file that locks on a block
#   after N. The other two nodes have a LIB that is less than or equal to block N.
#
# All nodes are shut down. The reversible blocks on all nodes is deleted. Restart all nodes from an earlier snapshot.
#
# All nodes eventually sync up to block N. Some nodes will consider block N to LIB but others may not.
#
# Not enough finalizers should be voting because of the lock in their finalizer safety information file. Verify that
# LIB does not advance on any node.
#
# Cleanly shut down all nodes and delete their finalizer safety information files. Then restart the nodes.
#
# Verify that LIB advances on all nodes and they all agree on the LIB. In particular, verify that block N is the
# same ID on all nodes as the one before nodes were first shutdown.
