# production_pause_max_rev_blks_test
# Test --max-reversible-blocks works as expected.
#
# Setup:
#
# The test network consits of 3 nodes. 2 of them are producer nodes, with
# producera and producerb. Configure --max-reversible-blocks but
# disable --production-pause-vote-timeout-ms to avoid interference.
#
# node0: Enables block production for producera and has the finalizer key with
#        description of producera. Has vote-threads enabled. Connect to producerbNode.
# producerbNode: Enables block production for producerb. Has vote-threads enabled.
#        Connect to finalizerbNode and node0.
# finalizerbNode: Has the finalizer key with description of producerb.
#        Has vote-threads enabled. Connect to producerbNode.
#
# Test cases:
#
# 1. Bring down finalizerbNode. producerbNode and node0 should automatically
#    pause production due to the number of reversible blocks keeping growing
#    because not receiving votes from finalizerbNode and LIB stopping advancings.
# 2. Bring down node0 and restart it with a larger --max-reversible-blocks.
#    node0 should resume production until the new limit is reached.
# 3. Restart finalizerbNode. producerbNode and node0 should automatically unpause
#    production because the number of reversible blocks decreases due to LIB
#    advances on both nodes.
