In the above example, things are moving along normally until time t4 when a microfork occurs.
Instead of building block B4 off of block B3, the producer builds block B4 off of block B2.
And then going forward, for some reason, it takes slightly longer for votes to propagate that a
QC on a block cannot be formed in time to be included in the very next block; instead the QC goes
in the block after.

The finalizer of interest is voting on all of the blocks as they come. For this example, it is
sufficient to only have one finalizer. The first time the finalizer is forced to vote weak is on
block B4. As the other blocks continue to build on that new branch, it votes on them appropriately
and the producer collects the vote and forms a QC as soon as it can, which always remains one block
late. The finalizer should begin voting strong again starting with block B6. However, prior to the
changes described in this issue, the finalizer would remain stuck voting weak indefinitely.

The expected state of the fsi record for the finalizer after each vote is provided below. It also
records what the new LIB should be after processing the block. In addition to checking that the blocks
have the claims as required above and the LIB as noted below, the test should also check that the fsi
record after each vote is as expected below.

Meaning of the superscripts and marks on the votes:
The vote on block b was delayed in reaching the node for the producer p scheduled
for the block at the next time slot t after block b by enough that a block produced on time by
producer p for time slot t could not possibly utilize the vote in any QC the block could claim.
Furthermore, the delay is such that the earliest time slot at which producer p could
produce a block that utilizes the delayed vote is the time slot (t + d) where ...
¹ ... d = 1.
‡ ... d is infinite meaning the vote may never be received by producer p.
